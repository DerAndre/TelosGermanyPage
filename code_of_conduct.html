      <h1 class="mt-4 mb-3">Code of Conduct</h1>

      <!-- Team Members -->
      <h2>Commitment</h2>
      <p class="code-of-conduct-text">
        TelosGermany commits to having ongoing discussions with all token holders within the community designated communication channels. We will listen to all token holders opinions and do our best to use these opinions to form consensus within the token holder community. We understand that the community has multiple languages and will do our best to cater for these needs.
      </p>

      <h2>Arbitration Decisions</h2>
      <p class="code-of-conduct-text">
        TelosGermany will adhere to and support any arbitration ruling made by an appointed arbitrator. We will do all means necessary to ensure the ruling is carried out.
      </p>

      <h2>Constitution</h2>
      <p class="code-of-conduct-text">
        TelosGermany will support and defend the guidelines and governance set forth by the EOS.IO Constitution. We will not comply with any requests that are forbidden by the Constitution in order to protect the network. We will work hard to ensure the constitution is transparently communicated to all token holders.
      </p>

      <h2>Honesty, Integrity, and Ethics</h2>
      <p class="code-of-conduct-text">
        <!-- Todo: Check if Telos Constitution exists-->
        We declare we will always act with honesty and integrity while applying the highest ethical standards in all aspects of our conduct. This includes abiding by the EOS Constitution and Block Producer Agreement.
      </p>

      <h2>Network Performance</h2>
      <p class="code-of-conduct-text">
        Our First priority is maintaining and reinvesting revenues to support network infrastructure growth as the Telos blockchain scales. Security of our infrastructure will be taken extremely serious, we will conduct third party audits to provide absolute transparency to the community.
      </p>

      <h2>Financial Independence</h2>
      <p class="code-of-conduct-text">
        TelosGermany is bootstrapped and funded directly by the founding team’s personal capital. TelosGermany will not allow any investor to have financial or operational control over the company. It will disclose any investment into the company in complete transparency. TelosGermany will never own a percentage of another Block Producer Company.
      </p>

      <h2>Collaboration</h2>
      <p class="code-of-conduct-text">
        We believe it is a combined effort of the entire community to effectively run and govern the Telos Blockchain. TelosGermany participates in open discussions with the community and the Block.one team on a regular basis to contribute to any current technical or governance issues. With the decentralised and open source nature of Telos, based on EOS.IO, the role of a block producer is to lead from the front, nurturing an environment where collaboration is encouraged.
      </p>

      <h2>Transparency</h2>
      <p class="code-of-conduct-text">
        All revenue and transaction history will run through a publically displayed ledger. Activity statements, expenditure reports and beneficiary donation reports will be displayed at regular intervals for the Telos community to monitor.
      </p>

      <h2>Against Collusion</h2>
      <p class="code-of-conduct-text">
        TelosGermany will do all means possible to prevent collusion with other block producers and make any partnerships completely transparent to the community through regular reporting.
      </p>

      <h2>Amendments to our Code of Conduct</h2>
      <p class="code-of-conduct-text">
        Amendments to our Code of Conduct will be informed by the community’s will and will be broadcast to community members through all viable communication channels before formal adoption.
